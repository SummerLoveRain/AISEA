Members of the team were awarded the second prize of natural science by the Ministry of Education in 2020, undertook three research projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, presided over two sub-projects of the National Key Research and Development Program and one pre-research project of the installation and development, published more than 50 papers in well-known national journals such as JCP and SIAM Multiscale Model and Simulation, and granted one patent. Recently, they have successfully completed the development of a module for 3D ground stress modelling and display of shale gas; designed an efficient pre-processing method for rapid solution of large-scale linear equation systems for subsea oil field development, improving the simulation efficiency; established a reconstruction model and algorithm based on partial observation data of reactors and fuel rods, realizing data reconstruction and inversion of physical parameters.
